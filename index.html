    My name is Thomas. If you've come to this page, odds are you're wondering who I am. At least, I hope so, else this'll be really awkward.

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>For starts, I was born and raised in Kansas City, MO and have been here my whole life.
    I work for Rockhurst University as an IT Support Specialist, and love to play video games.</p>
  <p>Some of you may recognize me from a show called "Queer Eye" on Netflix! (Season 3 Episode 7, you should check it out ;) )</p>

  <p>
    Before you ask, yes it was an amazing experience. Though the time was short, I got a lot out of the experience with each individual interaction with the Fab Five members.

  <p>
    With Tan, I learned to be a little more adventurous with the types of clothes I wear, and to not be afraid of stripes.

  <p>
    With Antoni, I learned I still hate brussel sprouts, but I can use the cooking method to make other yummy vegetables!

  <p>
    With Jonathan, I learned to give my body more attention, and that my appearance isn't just for others, but for me as well.

  <a name="karamo"></a>
  <p>
    With Karamo, an important lesson I learned is a change in mindset. Being stuck in your head often leads to negative thoughts. Changing the way you view the situation can really change your mood. Instead of being nervous, talk yourself out of the anxiousness, and feel excited. Nervousness and excitement are one and the same, it's just a matter of perspective.

  <p>
    Bobby wasn't really a "one-on-one" person, but the work he did on the house was amazing! He helped Karamo out with convincing me to step out of my comfort zone,
    and walked me through the "get out of your head" talk.

    All in all, it was a fantastic experience, and I don't think anything will ever top this for a birthday gift.
