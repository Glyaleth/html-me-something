    My name is Thomas. If you've come to this page, odds are you're wondering who I am. At least, I hope so, else this'll be really awkward.
  </p>
  <p>For starts, I was born and raised in Kansas City, MO and have been here my whole life.
    I work for Rockhurst University as an Information Technology Support Specialist (IT Support for short), and love to play video games.</p>
